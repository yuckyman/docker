# docker compose stacks for wger
Contains 3 docker compose environments:

* prod (in root of this repository)
* dev (uses sqlite)
* dev-postgres (uses postgresql)

The production Docker Compose file initializes a production environment with the
application server, a reverse proxy, a database, a caching server, and a Celery
queue, all configured. Data is persisted in volumes, if you want to use folders,
read the warning in the env file.

**TLDR:** just do `docker compose up -d`

For more details, consult the documentation (and the config files):

* production: <https://wger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/docker.html>
* development: <https://wger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/docker.html>

It is recommended to regularly pull the latest version of the compose file,
since sometimes new configurations or environmental variables are added.

## wger + wearipedia Cronometer sync

### what this adds

- goal: daily pull from Cronometer and track in your self-hosted wger (exercise + nutrition), with safe, idempotent writes.
- components:
  - wger services: web, db, cache, nginx, celery_worker, celery_beat
  - cronometer_sync sidecar (`sync/cronometer`): Python 3.11 + wearipedia; supercronic schedules runs; posts weight entries to wger and logs full payload for future ingest

### configuration (`config/prod.env`)

- CRONOMETER_SOURCE=WEARIPEDIA
- CRONOMETER_EMAIL, CRONOMETER_PASSWORD
- CRONOMETER_RANGE_DAYS (default 3), CRONOMETER_CRON (default `0 3 * * *`)
- WGER_API_URL=http://web:8000, WGER_API_TOKEN=<token>

### data flow

- sidecar authenticates to Cronometer via wearipedia
- fetches window: dailySummary, servings, exercises, biometrics
- posts weight biometrics to wger `api/v2/weightentry/`:
  - converts lbsâ†’kg
  - idempotent by date (skips if an entry exists)
  - requires `Authorization: Token <WGER_API_TOKEN>`
- logs the full fetched payload (for later bulk nutrition ingest)

### scheduling

- supercronic reads CRONOMETER_CRON; default 03:00 daily

### manual run + logs

- run now: `docker compose exec -T cronometer_sync python /app/main.py`
- logs: `docker compose logs --tail=200 cronometer_sync`

### token (self-hosted)

Generate once:

```
docker compose exec -T web python3 manage.py shell -c 'from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model; from rest_framework.authtoken.models import Token; u=get_user_model().objects.get(username="admin"); t,_=Token.objects.get_or_create(user=u); print(t.key)'
```

Set `WGER_API_TOKEN` in `config/prod.env`.

### next steps (nutrition)

- Add a custom endpoint (`/api/v2/external/cronometer-ingest/`) to validate, enqueue, and upsert nutrition diary entries in bulk; or map to existing endpoints (`nutritiondiary`, `meal`, `mealitem`).
